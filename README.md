# Implementation of the Julia set
_THIS CONTAINS OUTDATED OpenGl CODE BUT FOR FOR CONSISTENCY WITH nVidia TUTORIALS IT'LL BE USED AS IT IS_


This branch aims to offer a comparison of the Julia set algorithm between a **CPU** implementation and a **GPU** one.

This branch follows the indications given in _CUDA by Example, An introduction to General-Purpose GPU Programming_
